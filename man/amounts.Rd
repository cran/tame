\arguments{
\item{only}{<\code{\link[dplyr:dplyr_data_masking]{data-masking}}> Expressions that
return a logical value, and are defined in terms of the variables in
\code{object} and/or \code{additional_data}.

The default \code{NULL} selects all clusterings in \code{object}.}

\item{clusters}{<\code{\link[dplyr:dplyr_tidy_select]{tidy-select}}> An unquoted
expression naming the cluster or clusters in \code{object} one wants to
see summaries of. Names can be used as if they were positions in the data
frame, so expressions like I:IV can be used to select a range of clusters.

The default \code{NULL} selects all clusters in the chosen clusterings of
\code{object}.}

\item{count_grouper}{A function for grouping counts. As a standard it groups
counts as 1 medication, 2 medications, and 3+ medications.}

\item{additional_data}{A data frame with additional data that may be
(left-)joined onto the \code{parameters} in \code{object}. This is often
used in conjuction with \code{only} to select specific clusterings based on
\code{additional_data}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the internal summary function.
\itemize{
\item \code{cluster_wise}  an option in the \code{medications()} function.
\item \code{m} an option in the \code{medications()} function. A numeric restricting the
number of distinct ATC codes plotted within each cluster. That is, the
(at most) \code{m} most frequent ATC codes within that cluster is given a
color.
\item \code{q} an option in the \code{medications()} function. A numeric between 0 and 1
restricting the minimal ATC codes frequency displayed within each
cluster.
\item \code{count_grouper} an option in the \code{amounts()} function. A function for
grouping counts. As a standard it groups counts as 1 medication, 2
medications, and 3+ medications.
\item \code{atc_groups} A data.frame specifying the ATC groups to summaries by. The
data.frame must have two columns: (1) \code{regex} giving regular expressions
specifying the wanted ATC groups and (2) \code{atc_groups} the name of this
ATC grouping. As a standard the anatomical level (first level) of the ATC
codes is used.

}
\value{
\code{amounts()} returns a data frame of class \code{summary.medic.amounts}
\itemize{
\item \code{cluster_name} the name of the clustering.
\item \code{cluster} the cluster name.
\item \code{m} number of ATC codes.
\item \code{n_people} number of people in \code{cluster} that has \code{m} different ATC codes.
\item \code{n_medications} the total number of medication across people in this
\code{cluster} with \code{m} different ATC codes.
\item \code{p_people_analysis} percentage of people in \code{cluster} with \code{m} different
ATC codes in analysis.
\item \code{p_people_cluster} percentage of people with \code{m} different ATC codes in
\code{cluster}.
\item \code{p_medications_in_analysis} percentage of medication given in \code{cluster}
with \code{m} different ATC codes in analysis.
\item \code{p_medications_in_cluster} percentage of medication given with \code{m}
different ATC codes in \code{cluster}.
\item \code{p_people_with_n_unique_medications} percentage of people in \code{cluster}
with \code{m} different ATC codes.
\item \code{p_medications_with_n_unique_medications} percentage of medication in
\code{cluster} with \code{m} different ATC codes.

\description{
The function \code{amounts()} calculates the number of unique
medications for each individual and presents the count frequencies by
cluster.
}
\details{
\code{amounts()} calculates the number of ATC codes an individual has, and then
outputs the number of individuals within a cluster that has that many ATC
codes. Moreover, various relevant percentages or calculated. See Value below
for more details on these percentages.
